# Welcome to the precompiled ABIs from Rootstock

Here you will find the ABIs for the existing precompiled contracts in Rootstock. You will also get their addresses and a builder to use it with [web3js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3).

# Version

Different versions of the package mentioned are required for different Rootstock releases.

Until Fingerroot, the semantic versioning of this package doesnâ€™t correlate to the semantic versioning of Rootstock. For each named release of Rootstock, there will be a corresponding name version in npm.

This package's support starts with ORCHID.

# How to use it

For the installation of these package you must execute in a terminal window:

```shell
npm install @rsksmart/rsk-precompiled-abis@<version>
```

As an example to define and use it:

1) Include the Web3 package.

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
```

2) Include the `rsk-precompiled-abis` package.

```javascript
const precompiled = require('@rsksmart/rsk-precompiled-abis');
```

3) Create an instance of the contract using package build method and Web3 as a parameter.

(i.e.: using Bridge)

```shell
var bridge = precompiled.bridge.build(new Web3('http://localhost:4444'));
```

4) Use a contract's method. For example, here we call `getFederationAddress`, and displays its result in the console.

```shell
bridge.methods.getFederationAddress().call().then(console.log);
```

# Important note

If the version to be installed is not defined in the command line, it will install the latest version by default.
